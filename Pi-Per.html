        Subtraction is the process of taking a matrix, vector, or other quantity away from another under specific rules to obtain the difference.<br>
        Multiplication is the process of combining matrices, vectors, or other quantities under specific rules to obtain their product.<br>
        Division is a mathematical operation which involves the sharing of an amount into equal-sized groups.<br>

        Example 1:<br>
        Solution (b):<br>
         Step 1: Calculate the difference between each pair of adjacent terms.<br>
        2 – 1 = 1<br>
        3 – 2 = 1<br>
        5 – 3 = 2<br>
        8 – 5 = 3<br>
         Step 2: Compare the differences. Since the differences between each<br>
         pair of adjacent terms are not all the same, the sequence is not<br>
         arithmetic.<br>
        An arithmetic sequence is determined completely by the first term a, and the common
        difference d. Thus, if we know the first two terms of an arithmetic sequence, then we can
        find the equation for the nth term.<br>
        Finding the Terms of an Arithmetic Sequence:<br>
        Example 2: Find the nth term, the fifth term, and the 100th term, of the arithmetic
        sequence determined by a = 2 and d = 3.<br>
        Solution: To find a specific term of an arithmetic sequence, we use the formula
         for finding the nth term.<br>
         Step 1: The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by<br>
        an = a + (n – 1)d.<br>
         So, to find the nth term, substitute the given values a = 2 and
         d = 3 into the formula.<br>
        an = 2 + (n – 1)3<br>
         Step 2: Now, to find the fifth term, substitute n = 5 into the equation for
         the nth term.<br>
        a5 = 2 + (5 – 1)3<br>
         = 14<br>
         Step 3: Finally, find the 100th term in the same way as the fifth term.<br>
        a100 = 2 + (100 – 1)3<br>
         = 299<br>
        Example 3: Find the common difference, the fifth term, the nth term, and the 100th
        term of the arithmetic sequence.<br>
        (a) 4, 14, 24, 34, …<br>
        (b) 15 9 21 3, , , , ... 424<br>
        tt t t ++ + +<br>
        Solution (a): In order to find the nth and 100th terms, we will first have to
         determine what a and d are. We will then use the formula for
         finding the nth term.<br>
         Step 1: First, we will determine what a and d are. The number a is
         always the first term of the sequence, so<br>
         a = 4<br>
         The difference between any pair of adjacent terms should be the
         same because the sequence is arithmetic, so we can choose any
         one pair to find the common difference d. If we choose the first
         two terms then<br>
        d = 14 – 4<br>
         = 10<br>
         Step 2: Since we are given the fourth term, we can add the common
         difference d = 10 to it to get the fifth term.<br>
         a5 = 34 + 10<br>
         = 44<br>
         Step 3: Now to find the nth term, substitute a = 4 and d = 10 into the
         formula for the nth term.<br>
         an = 4 + (n – 1)10<br>
         Step 4: Finally, substitute n = 100 into the equation for the nth term to
         get the 100th term.<br>
         a100 = 4 + (100 – 1)10<br>
         = 994<br>
        Example 3:<br>
        Solution (b):<br>
         Step 1: Calculate a and d.<br>
         a = t + 3<br>

 equation.<br>

Example 4 (Continued):<br>
Solution (b): This is the sum of the first fourteen terms of the arithmetic
 sequence having an = 2n – 7.<br>
 Step 1: Since the partial sum is given in summation notation, we must
 first find a and an. From the given information we know k = 2,
 c = –7, and n = 14, so<br>
2 ( 7)<br>

 Step 2: Now that we know a = -5, n = 14, and a14 = 21, we can substitute
 these values into the second formula for the nth partial sum to
 find the fourteenth partial sum.<br>

Example 5: Find the sum of the first 37 even numbers.<br>
Solution:<br>
 Step 1: First, we must find the values a, d, and n. Since the first even
 number is zero, a = 0. The next even number is 2, so<br>
 d = 2 – 0 = 2. Since we are told to find the sum of the first 37
 even numbers, n = 37.<br>
Example 5 (Continued):<br>
 Step 2: Now that we know a = 0, d = 2, and n = 37 we can solve this
 problem the same way as in the previous example. First find
 a37, and then substitute the values for a, d, and a37 into the
 equation for the nth partial sum. Thus,<br>
37 0 37 1 2 ( )<br>

a =+ −<br>

<br>
=<br>
Example 6:<br>
A partial sum of an arithmetic sequence is given. Find the sum.<br>
1 + 8 + 15 + … + 78<br>
Solution:<br>
 Step 1: As in the previous example, we must first find a, d, and n. The
 values a and d are easy to find.<br>
a = 1<br>
 d = 8 – 1<br>
 = 7<br>
 Now, finding n is a bit more work because we are not explicitly
told how many numbers we will be summing. We know a and d,
and we know the nth term, so we will substitute these values into
the formula for the nth term of a sequence.<br>
aan d n =+ − ( 1)<br>
78 1 1 7 =+ − (n )<br>
Now solve for n.<br>
77 1 7 ( )<br>
11 1<br>
12<br>
n<br>
n<br>
n<br>
= −<br>
= −<br>
=<br>
 Therefore, we will be summing twelve terms and . 12 78 = a<br>
Example 6 (Continued):<br>
 Step 2: Now that we know a = 1, n = 12, and a12 = 78 we can solve this
 problem the same way as in example 4. Substitute the values for
 a, d, and a12 into the formula for the nth partial sum.<br>
 S12=12(1+78/2)<br>
=474 </p5>
